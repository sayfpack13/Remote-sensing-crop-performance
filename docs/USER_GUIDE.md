- **Colors**:
  - **Dark Green**: Healthy, dense vegetation
  - **Light Green**: Moderate vegetation
  - **Yellow/Brown**: Sparse vegetation
  - **Gray**: Barren land
  - **Black**: Water bodies

##### 2. NDVI Histogram
- **X-axis**: NDVI values (-1 to +1)
- **Y-axis**: Number of pixels
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Left side (negative)**: Water and barren areas
  - **Center (0 to 0.3)**: Sparse to moderate vegetation
  - **Right side (0.3+)**: Dense, healthy vegetation

##### 3. Color Legend
- **Purpose**: Reference for interpreting overlay colors
- **Scale**: Maps NDVI values to colors used in the overlay

##### 4. Crop Yield Estimate
Statistical information including:
- **Crop Type**: Selected crop
- **Total Area**: Total analyzed area in hectares
- **Vegetated Area**: Area covered by vegetation
- **Average Yield**: Expected yield per hectare for selected crop
- **Estimated Total Yield**: Calculated total yield in tons

## Understanding NDVI Values

### NDVI Basics
- **Range**: -1 to +1
- **Calculation**: (Near Infrared - Red) / (Near Infrared + Red)
- **Purpose**: Measures vegetation health and density

### NDVI Interpretation
| NDVI Range | Vegetation Type | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| -1.0 to -0.1 | Water/No vegetation | Water bodies, concrete, bare soil |
| -0.1 to 0.1 | Barren | Very sparse or no vegetation |
| 0.1 to 0.3 | Sparse vegetation | Grasslands, sparse crops |
| 0.3 to 0.6 | Moderate vegetation | Healthy crops, forests |
| 0.6 to 1.0 | Dense vegetation | Very healthy, dense vegetation |

## Best Practices

### Area Selection
1. **Start Small**: Begin with areas < 5 km¬≤ to familiarize yourself with the interface
2. **Cloud-Free Areas**: Choose areas with minimal cloud cover
3. **Homogeneous Crops**: Select areas with uniform crop types for more accurate estimates
4. **Seasonal Timing**: Consider the growing season of your target crop

### Analysis Settings
1. **Resolution Selection**:
   - **Detailed Analysis**: Use 1-5 meters per pixel
   - **Regional Overview**: Use 10-20 meters per pixel
   - **Quick Assessment**: Use 20+ meters per pixel

2. **Layer Selection**:
   - **Crop Health**: Use NDVI
   - **Water Stress**: Use Moisture Index
   - **Visual Assessment**: Use True Color
   - **Vegetation Structure**: Use False Color

### Interpreting Results
1. **Cross-Reference**: Compare NDVI overlay with true color image
2. **Histogram Analysis**: Look for bimodal distributions (vegetation vs. non-vegetation)
3. **Seasonal Considerations**: NDVI values vary by growth stage
4. **Field Validation**: Ground-truth results when possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Results Displayed
**Possible Causes**:
- Area too large (reduce size or increase resolution value)
- Network connectivity issues
- Sentinel Hub API limits exceeded

**Solutions**:
1. Try a smaller area
2. Check internet connection
3. Wait and retry (API limits reset daily)

#### Poor Image Quality
**Possible Causes**:
- High resolution value
- Cloud cover in the area
- Atmospheric conditions

**Solutions**:
1. Lower the resolution value (higher quality)
2. Select a different area or time period
3. Try different satellite layers

#### Unrealistic Yield Estimates
**Possible Causes**:
- Wrong crop type selected
- Area includes non-agricultural land
- NDVI analysis on non-vegetated areas

**Solutions**:
1. Verify crop type selection
2. Draw more precise boundaries around crop fields
3. Exclude roads, buildings, and water bodies

### Error Messages

#### "Please draw an area on the map first"
- **Cause**: No rectangle drawn on the map
- **Solution**: Use the rectangle tool to draw an analysis area

#### "Invalid bounding box"
- **Cause**: Drawing coordinates are invalid
- **Solution**: Redraw the rectangle and ensure it's within valid geographic bounds

#### "Error fetching data from Sentinel Hub"
- **Cause**: External API issue or network problem
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and retry after a few minutes

## Advanced Features

### Comparing Different Time Periods
1. Analyze the same area multiple times
2. Save/screenshot results for comparison
3. Note seasonal changes in NDVI values

### Multi-Layer Analysis
1. Analyze the same area with different layers
2. Compare True Color, NDVI, and Moisture Index
3. Cross-validate findings across layers

### Yield Optimization

2. Correlate with field management practices
3. Plan targeted interventions for improvement

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- Maximum processing area: ~50 km¬≤ (depending on resolution)
- Image resolution: Limited by Sentinel satellite capabilities
- Processing time: Depends on area size and server load

### Data Limitations
- **Cloud Cover**: Can obscure ground features
- **Temporal Resolution**: Snapshot in time, not continuous monitoring
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Can affect spectral values

### Analysis Limitations
- **Yield Estimates**: Based on general crop coefficients, not field-specific data
- **Crop Type Detection**: Manual selection required
- **Mixed Pixels**: Large pixels may contain multiple land cover types

## Tips for Accurate Analysis

1. **Season Selection**: Analyze during peak growing season for best results
2. **Weather Conditions**: Choose clear, cloud-free days
3. **Field Knowledge**: Combine satellite analysis with ground observations
4. **Multiple Analyses**: Compare results across different dates
5. **Validation**: Cross-check estimates with actual yield data when available
